# Classification of Robbery Crimes in Urban Toronto


**Introduction:**

Understanding the complex interplay of socio-economic, temporal, and spatial factors in shaping crime dynamics within urban environments is essential for developing effective crime prevention strategies and safeguarding community well-being. In the bustling metropolis of Toronto, where crime incidents unfold daily, there is a pressing need to explore the underlying determinants of criminal behavior, particularly in high-risk scenarios such as robbery crimes. As a student residing in Toronto, the urgency to comprehend these dynamics is palpable, driven by a desire to mitigate personal risk and contribute to broader efforts aimed at fostering safer neighborhoods.

**Research Question:**

Do temporal and spatial patterns, along with the socio-economic conditions of neighborhoods, significantly impact the likelihood of robbery crimes occurring in Toronto across different neighborhoods? 

- Temporal factors include season, month, day of the week, hour of the day, and the presence of sunset at the time of the crime.

- Spatial patterns encompass longitude, latitude, and premise type of the location of the crime.

- Socio-economic indicators of neighborhoods such as income levels, housing density, number of rental properties, permanent job and labor force ratio, transportation service worker and population ratio, healthcare service worker and population ratio, and the difference in individuals' median and average income, will also be considered.
